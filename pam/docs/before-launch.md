# To do before launching Pam

Will's list of what must be true before real people use Pam. Add to it when
Will says "before launch", tick items off with the date and who did it, and
never delete one: a done item stays, struck through, so the list is also the
record of how launch was reached.

`STATUS.md` → "What needs a human" holds every open question; this list is
the subset that **blocks launch**. When an item here is done, update its
STATUS row too.

## Open

- [ ] **Set up the email provider for invite links** (Will, 4 October 2026,
  D-263). The expired-link page already queues a fresh link in
  `public.invite_emails` (live since 0071); nothing sends it yet. Needs:
  1. Pick a provider (Resend, Postmark or SendGrid all work from a Supabase
     Edge Function) and a from-address on Pam's own domain, with SPF/DKIM
     set up for it.
  2. Put the provider's API key in Supabase Edge Function secrets — never in
     this repo.
  3. Write the sender: an Edge Function on a schedule (like the SMS
     dispatcher, 0039/0040) that reads unsent `invite_emails` rows, builds the
     link with the new invite's code, renders `renderInviteEmail()` from
     `@pam/config/invite-email` (approved by Will, 4 October), sends it, and
     sets `sent_at`.
  4. Send one to yourself and check it in Gmail, Apple Mail and Outlook.

  Until this is done, someone with an expired link is told "Check your email"
  and nothing arrives.

- [ ] **Merge and deploy 0068 and 0069** (readiness fixes and blocking, on
  branch `claude/hopeful-thompson-07nj7n`, not yet on this one). 0068 is what
  lets an invite be redeemed at all (phone format) and closes several live
  holes (D-204–D-207). **0069 rewrites `can_message`, and so did 0072 (now
  live)** — whichever is deployed second wins, so 0069 must be rebased to keep
  0072's super admin ↔ staff arm before it goes live. Run the DB suite on the
  merged result first.
  - Merged and rebased 7 October as **0075/0076** (D-346): `can_message` keeps
    0072's arm, the DB suite passes. **Left: apply 0075 then 0076 to the live
    project, approving their `drop` statements.**

- [ ] **Approve the Pam-team line on the transparency screen** (STATUS row
  10b). Members were promised they would hear first if what is visible
  changes; the super admin's Everyone list and invite log are visible now.

- [ ] **Review the SMS copy** still waiting for a name in `reviewedBy`
  (STATUS row 2).

## Done

_(nothing yet)_
- [ ] Text-message samples re-filed with the carrier with the "Pam:" prefix (D-321, 6 October 2026).
- [ ] A reviewed `booked_visit` SMS template (D-322): "Pam: {place} booked you for {day} at {time}. Tap to see it in Pam: {link}" — first contact, carries STOP; a human signs `reviewedBy`.
